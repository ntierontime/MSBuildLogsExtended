irXML™ The Cornerstone of Control for IR Websites XML development tool specifically designed to deliver maximum flexibility and XML control for investor relations websites v2.0 IrXML™ The Cornerstone of Control | 1

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The web is the standard communication avenue for investor relations officers (IROs) to reach the investment community and the IR website has become the centerpiece of that outreach and strategy. From stock quotes to updated SEC filings and earnings call webcasts, the IR website is the one- stop shop for current and prospective shareholders and institutions who want in-depth information about public companies. The IR website is part of the public company’s general website. But unlike the majority of the corporate website content, the IR section is the one website component the company webmaster does not have control over. From the data supplying the stock price numbers to webcast management and production, almost all IR best practice companies outsource their IR websites to third parties like Shareholder.com. At Shareholder.com, we were looking for a way to help our clients who wanted to bring their IR websites in-house for budget, security or personnel reasons. We found it with the maturation of a new Internet standard called XML (see the section below for more background on XML). We took the benefits of the XML technology – specifically its flexibility and control – and adapted it into a customized application – irXML.™ irXML is the first version of XML designed to help IROs create, host and manage their IR website the way they want. If a company needs to design or host its IR website in-house, irXML is the solution. irXML also frees web designers’ and webmasters’ creativity: enabling them to create a robust IR website without knowing specifics about the IR industry or SEC regulations. …to help IROs create, host and manage their IR website the way they want. IrXML™ The Cornerstone of Control | 2

Here are some, but not all, of the essential IR website features irXML delivers. A complete list can be found in the Appendix – Complete irXML Functions and IR Tags toward the end of this paper. Stock quotes and stock charts News Releases Earnings estimates from the company and third parties SEC documents Event and shareholder calendars Analyst information Fulfillment and printed material request Stock calculators Investor-customized web pages (i.e. “My IR page”) With an IRO providing guidance and a technical web designer or webmaster supervising production, a company can use irXML to produce part or all of a robust IR website without limitations. They no longer need to rely on multiple third parties for content, support, maintenance or hosting. Once the IR website is complete, irXML continues using the Shareholder.com database and libraries to refresh the site with material information like real-time stock quotes, historical data, SEC documentation, earnings estimates, and other data sets from a variety of industry-leading sources …to produce part or all of a robust IR website without limitations. IrXML™ The Cornerstone of Control | 3

What is XML? XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the international standards body for the Internet, recommended companies begin using XML in 1998. XML has steadily gained converts and acceptance and is now becoming widespread throughout the technology world. XML is both an outgrowth and upgrade of HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), the current standard that is used to develop many web sites, including your IR website. The primary difference between HTML and XML lies in how the web page information is used and set up. HTML can only dictate how text can be shown and interacted with. But with XML, your data – the most important part of the web page – takes center stage. Your data can be tagged as a stock quote, phone number or whatever else it needs to be. And unlike HTML, which has a fixed number of markup tags, there is no limit on the markup tags that can be used with XML. Use as many as you want and define them yourself. To make it simple, HTML specifies how the data displays, while XML defines how the data functions. For the technically savvy webmaster, XML is relatively easy to learn, and it greatly facilitates website development and construction. Since you determine how content is labeled, it is very easy to take that content and modify it, transplant it into another application and even “scrape” the XML code from your web site to another web site (for example, your company intranet) and use it any way you want. This ability to exchange data between systems and applications is one of XML’s best features. A shareholder can quickly transfer earnings statements from your website. You can send an agent to collect necessary information from your competitors’ websites. The freedom XML offers fulfills the primary principles of the Internet – free exchange of information. …with irXML, your data – the most important part of the web page – takes center stage… IrXML™ The Cornerstone of Control | 4

irXML Checklist / Preamble If you want to begin using irXML for your IR website, we recommend the following criteria are met with and agreed to: All Shareholder.com clients have access to a dedicated client account manager and web developer… You must have a technical webmaster who is familiar with some form of interactive development environment, such as ASP, Perl, or Cold Fusion. If your webmaster has not worked with a third-party data provider before, pre-production code must be reviewed by a Shareholder.com technical resource prior to making the irXML feed live. You also have the option to have a Shareholder.com tech resource visit your company to help set up irXML in your server environment. The technical resource at your company must communicate any concerns or issues with the IR site to the primary IR contact at your company. You will receive phone or email communication from the Shareholder.com web developer no less than every two weeks so we can answer your questions and ensure your success at using irXML Prior to turning your irXML feed live, Shareholder.com must be able to access your pages via a browser so we can test the site and make recommendations as needed. We want you to go live with irXML only after thorough testing. If the technical contact at your company changes, please notify your Shareholder.com web developer so we can train a new person or take your IR website hosting back on our server. We will work closely with you to ensure that your transition to irXML will be smooth. All Shareholder.com clients have access to a dedicated client account manager and web developer who are well- trained in irXML implementation. IrXML™ The Cornerstone of Control | 5

Technical Overview Shareholder.com has been using irXML internally to create and host our IR websites since December 2000. Today, after much refining, testing and live deployment, this architecture is available for any server in the world. Shareholder.com developed irXML so web developers could have complete control over every aspect of their IR website design and branding. This enables irXML-designed sites, whether created by Shareholder.com or our clients, to match clients’ corporate sites seamlessly without the use of any templates, resulting in unique and highly customized IR websites. With irXML, the logic that accesses the data is centralized, optimized and secure. This means the standard obstacles facing web developers are greatly reduced in order to meet and exceed website design goals. This separation of functionality from design has also standardized and simplified accessing Shareholder.com's database of IR information. Web developers simply declare what information they want, it is supplied in XML, and displayed in any manner – whether that be on a web page, an email alert, or even imported directly into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. The standards that Shareholder.com spearheaded have been developed with the web developer in mind. Whether fluent in ASP, Cold Fusion, Java, open-source PHP, Perl, or client-side only JavaScript and HTML, the developer can utilize irXML totally within that language. The developer does not need to learn any additional languages or any emerging technologies. Shareholder.com's API lets the developer focus on creating a website rather than learning a new way to process data and display content. This provides the client with all the benefits of adopting XML without the added cost of developing and maintaining additional infrastructure. … Web developers simply declare what information they want. … IrXML™ The Cornerstone of Control | 6

It’s simple to collect data from Shareholder.com's database of investor relations content. For web developers this is done using the server-side or client-side language of their choice. After the web page has requested the data, the web server language recognizes the data as XML and does all the behind-the-scenes work to process the delivered content. Then the developer simply declares, in his or her familiar web programming language, the result variable of the data requested, just like any other variable. IrXML™ The Cornerstone of Control | 7

irXML Example To illustrate irXML’s benefits throughout this paper, we will focus on the example of a company’s stock quote, one of the most popular and common functions of a company’s IR website. While we will focus on the stock quote and its API function, the example applies to any other feature of an IR website developed with irXML. When a developer requests the stock quote function, they are supplied with data that includes Last Price (most recent stock price), Day High (highest price that day) and Year High (highest price that year). Shareholder.com's API will automatically convert those data points into the server language variables called “LastPrice,” “DayHigh” and “YearHigh” directly from the XML. IR functions, which the developer or designer may not be aware of, are built into irXML. Sample request and output for the developer would be as simple as: Various website development languages request of irXML data: ASP: sRobotUrl = "http://www.shareholder.com/irxml/irxml.cfm?ticker=ABC&function="StockQuote" CFM: PHP: fopen("http://www.shareholder.com/irxml/irxml.cfm?ticker=ABC&function="StockQuote", "r"); JavaScript: Various website development languages output of variables: ASP: <%= MyRS.getField(1,"LASTPRICE") %> CFM: #LastPrice# PHP: print "$LastPrice"; JavaScript: document.write(LastPrice); Since irXML is only data, these output variables can be placed in any HTML website design. There is no need to learn or know any aspects of XML or its core … only needs to know their own interactive web programming environment… IrXML™ The Cornerstone of Control | 8

requirements to achieve the benefits XML provides. Shareholder.com has done that for the developer. The developer only needs to know their own interactive web programming environment. If a web developer wants to change a link color or the formatting of dates, only one configuration modification is needed to change that attribute across the ENTIRE corporate site, including the IR section. IrXML™ The Cornerstone of Control | 9

irXML Architecture Shareholder.com has been providing IR communications solutions since 1992, and has a long history of pioneering new IR technologies from IR websites to webcasts and dynamic HTML documents. With irXML, we have compiled a comprehensive list of all the IR functions your company needs. The choices are limitless; the choice is yours. When your IR web page is accessed, an HTTP request provides your ticker symbol to Shareholder.com’s irXML servers. Shareholder.com’s irXML database servers gather all the stock quote data for the ticker symbols requested. It then packages it in XML and returns it to your server. Once the XML code is received, you can use the elements in any manner you wish. You can create a quote table, scrolling java ticker, or even benchmark your stock against an index or competitor on your intranet. The choices are limitless; the choice is yours. IrXML™ The Cornerstone of Control | 10

Unique IR Code Generator Fuels Webmasters and Designers Shareholder.com has greatly enhanced the usability of its irXML API for the web developer. These feature-rich enhancements provide access to a client-specific, web-based help system, which allows developers to reference any and all aspects of the API and specific IR functions. This helps an IR neophyte quickly design and implement a high-quality IR website. These IR attributes include required and optional input fields. For example, when requesting data from Shareholder.com's database, the API has to know what function and data is being requested. Therefore, Function=StockQuote is a required attribute that will return specific stock symbol data. For this function, Ticker=ABC is also required so that the API will return the correct information associated with the requested stock symbol, in this case ABC. Optionally, the developer can request the stock quote data from a specific date. To do this, the developer will request from the API TradeDate=6/1/2001. If the TradeDate is not specified the API will assume that the current day's stock quote data is requested. The final call would look like: www.shareholder.com/irxml/irxml.cfm?ticker=ABC&function=StockQuote or ( )=ABC&function=StockQuote&TradeDate=6/1/2001 The code generator outlines all the available configuration possibilities available to the developer. It will also describe how certain functions act together, such as Function=DocumentRequest. When a developer requests this, a list of all available hardcopy (and electronic) IR documents can be displayed on one web page, thus allowing the shareholder to select which IR documents (Annual Report, Press Releases, etc.) they would like to have sent to them. … quickly design and implement a high quality IR website … IrXML™ The Cornerstone of Control | 11

The code generator not only describes this, but also indicates that Function=DocumentRequestUpdate is called after the shareholder clicks on a 'Submit' button. This function, DocumentRequestUpdate, submits the shareholder's demographic data (shipping address, for example) to the fulfillment center, whether that center is located at Shareholder.com or the client's facility. irXML is so flexible that DocumentRequest could be used in email or a wireless device rather than a web page. IrXML™ The Cornerstone of Control | 12

…upon clicking a 'Submit' button, the next page will automatically construct the URL… The code generator is also highly interactive. If the developer is viewing the information about the function StockQuote, they can enter the stock ticker symbol and, optionally, the date of the stock quote data. Upon clicking a 'Submit' button, the next page will automatically construct the IrXML™ The Cornerstone of Control | 13

URL to request the exact data desired. The code generator will also generate basic HTML code (with specific server-side language familiar to the website developer) that can easily be copied and pasted into a web page on the corporate server, and that code will work immediately. The developer can take the irXML data and use it with any HTML. …and that code will work immediately. IrXML™ The Cornerstone of Control | 14

Sample retrieval of irXML Let’s run through an example of how a developer or webmaster uses irXML to develop an IR website. First they call the API in the web page that is going to display the results of the irXML call. This example will again use the function StockQuote in the Cold Fusion web server language. ------------- code snip -------------------------- ------------- end code snip -------------------------- When the API receives this request for StockQuote data from a web page it formats the HTTP request and submits the request to Shareholder.com’s irXML servers. Below is a sample of XML that is returned from the irXML servers to the API residing on the client’s web server. 4.100 2002-09-12 16:10:01 < number >4.020 < number >3.870 < number >3.900 After the API requests the data, it will parse this XML and translate it into the specific web server language. For example, ColdFusion (*.cfm) can be accessed as: ------------- code snip -------------------------- Last Price: #LastPrice#
Day High: #DayHigh#
Day Low: #DayLow#
------------- end code snip -------------------------- IrXML™ The Cornerstone of Control | 15

… just one of over 45 IR functions to aid web developers The web developer never sees the XML but the data points within the XML are available to the developer as normal variables. This work is done behind the scenes with Shareholder.com’s irXML API. The developer gets the full benefits of XML without ever having to know anything about XML. Furthermore, the developer doesn’t have to know how to interact with the API. Using the code generator, the developer can just copy and paste the API interface code directly into his or her web page. This stock quote example illustrates just one of over 45 IR functions that irXML has stored to aid web developers. A full list can be accessed in the API and Functions – Stock Quote section. Shareholder.com has also developed tools that plug into various desktop software programs that provide the same functionality of the code generator, but in a local, wizard or drag-and-drop version. This allows the web developer to access all irXML functionality anywhere and anytime. IrXML™ The Cornerstone of Control | 16

How to Access irXML All irXML functions are accessed at the same URL – http://www.shareholder.com/irxml/irxml.cfm. All calls to this secure URL require at least three URL variables: 1. CompanyID. This is a unique identifier that enables only this company’s data to be retrieved. 2. PIN. This is also a unique identifier that secures both input and output into Shareholder.com’s database. 3. Function. This tells the irXML platform what type of data is being requested. Since #1 and #2 don’t change they can easily be incorporated into the ‘included’ API file. Having the CompanyID and PIN in an external file aids in security, since the API file can reside outside the web server’s public HTML directory. Any number of parameters can be passed to the API, which will then correctly format the HTTP request to Shareholder.com’s irXML servers. The irXML platform is smart enough so that all variables are evaluated. If a non-valid variable is passed to irXML the platform ignores it. There are currently over 45 functions available to assist web developers. Future functions will also be able to access the API without any changes needed to the API or the irXML platform. The irXML platform is smart enough so that all variables are evaluated. IrXML™ The Cornerstone of Control | 17

Extensibility and Versioning There are many ways irXML can be enabled using Shareholder.com’s API. This API consists of one small file residing on the same web server where the website resides. The API never changes, making it maintenance-free, easy to add or enhance functionality, and ensures all pages on the website are extensible. Furthermore, Shareholder.com supplies this API file for many different web server platforms, including ASP, ColdFusion, PHP and JavaScript. For example, during initial website development, it is determined that earnings estimates are not needed on the website. Many months later, the IR department changes its mind. All the website developer needs to do is tell the API file what new function is needed, as well as any optional parameters. The API file then contacts Shareholder.com’s irXML servers and transforms the XML into the developer’s familiar web server-based language. This is the same process that is commonly used to include additional content, such as navigational menus. There is no need for the developer to configure each page to ‘talk’ our irXML servers. Small upgrades to the logic or content of the XML delivered to the client website can take place transparently without affecting any live website, or requiring a developer to do anything to their web page code. If Shareholder.com would like to add an additional field to the list of financial analysts that cover the client’s company, it would not affect the results of the API’s returning data. It would be up to the web developer to implement this additional data point on the web page. Occasionally, Shareholder.com needs to drastically change the logic and/or structure of an irXML function, and Shareholder.com’s irXML API can handle this very easily. By creating a new version of a function rather than altering a current function, web developers don’t have to worry about unexpected changes in their irXML data stream. … making it maintenance- free, easy to add or enhance functionality IrXML™ The Cornerstone of Control | 18

This has happened with the StockQuote function. StockQuote version 1 returned data points that would allow the web developer to create fractions of stock prices (5 ½, for example). These data points were LastPriceDenominator, LastPriceNumerator, and LastPriceInteger. When the stock markets started to change over to purely using decimals, Shareholder.com created StockQuote version 2. The version 2 StockQuote function does not send back LastPriceDenominator, LastPriceNumerator, or LastPriceInteger, but returns LastPrice as a float- type of number (5.50 for example). Shareholder.com considered this a drastic change in the StockQuote function. Version 2 was released prior to any stock market’s switch to decimals. This gave web developers ample time to test and implement the new version of StockQuote. This is one case where a change was mandated by the stock markets and was universally adopted by website developers. Shareholder.com has also issued a version 2 of the Conference Call function. This new version added new data points, and removed others. Since the removal of data points could severely impact live websites and require developers to test and implement changes on a fixed timeframe, it was decided the best solution would be to issue a new version. This would allow the developers to test and implement the new enhanced function ONLY if they wanted or needed the enhancement. Both versions are fully supported.
